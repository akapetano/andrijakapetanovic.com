### Front-end developer blog website

This is my developer blog website where I showcase all of my projects along with some blog posts about my web dev journey. I've built this website with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), and it was all built upon the demo built by following the [Create a Next.js App](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) tutorial. You can read more on the building process [here](https://www.andrijakapetanovic.com/blog/posts/my-first-post-and-the-journey-so-far).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load the font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
