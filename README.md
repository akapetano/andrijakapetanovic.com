### Front-end developer blog website

This is my developer blog website where I showcase all of my projects along with some blog posts about my web dev journey. I've built this website with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), and it was all built upon the demo built by following the [Create a Next.js App](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) tutorial. You can read more on the building process [here](https://www.andrijakapetanovic.com/blog/posts/my-first-post-and-the-journey-so-far).
