I did it! After 9 months of intensive learning, I launched my own website where I can showcase my work, effort, and thoughts which are sometimes trapped on this never-ending path of learning web development. The website has been built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), the [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework, and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), the modular component library for React.

I've built this website completely from scratch, however, this does not mean that I haven't had some help along the way, and here, in this first blog post, I would like to dissect the building process of this website. This will not only provide you with a blueprint of the website, but also give you an overview of my journey so far. So let's take a step back.
