After some time of coding (two years to be exact), after overcoming many hurdles, and frustration and finally getting to calmer waters, you start to think about the steps that led you to where you currently are in your career, and about the next steps that will lead you further to where you want to be. What keeps coming to my mind is a term that's often heard in the world of programming, the fundamentals. A lot of people by now are probably sick and tired of hearing about the fundamentals, but there's a good reason why they are frequently discussed. As a self-taught front-end developer, there are a lot gaping holes in my knowledge of programming. A way to close those gaps is to get good at the fundamentals. Hopefully, in time, I'll manage to patch the holes in my general knowledge of programming, but right now, I'll be focusing on the fundamentals of front-end development: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My goal here is to create a guide that I wish I had when I started learning web development.

### Emphasizing the mental in fundamental

When learning a new skill or sharpening an existing one, it's necessary to have a good mental model, or a good way of thinking about a certain topic. Naturally, introspection, examination of one's thoughts and/or feelings, is key in this regard since we need to be aware of our way of thinking about a certain topic. What's weird is that sometimes we might experience resistance from ourselves when trying to establish a good mental model by dismissing our attempts to think too much about a particular thing, thinking that we already understand that part, and that it's time to move on to another thing. But let's try to keep in this state of going through stuff that we even already understand as it might reveal that our understanding is flawed or incomplete.
